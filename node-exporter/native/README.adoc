# Installing node-exporter natively on an OpenShift Cluster

If you would like to run node-exporter natively on your OpenShift cluster you can use the playbook to deploy it to all the nodes in your cluster.

Simply point to the Ansible hosts file on your OpenShift bastion host and run the attached playbook. This will install the `node_exporter` binary in all hosts that are in the `nodes` group in the referenced hosts file. It will also set up a system service to automatically start the node_exporter.

[source,bash]
