# OpenShift Prometheus Alert Manager

The Alert Manager will be connected to Prometheus and send alerts when specific rules are hit.

The example implementation makes use of a link:https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/configuration/#<webhook_config>[webhook] to notify a target system.

The Alertmanager can be configured to support other or additional alerting mechanism by editing the ConfigMap `alertmanager` either in the template or after the Alertmanager has been deployed (in that case it needs to be restarted to pick up the new configuration).

## Deployment to OpenShift

Use the following steps to deploy Alertmanager to OpenShift:

[source,bash]
----
oc new-app -f alertmanager.yaml -p VOLUME_CAPACITY=4Gi -p "WEBHOOK_URL=<insert_url>"
----

NOTE: Be sure to substitute the value of the Webhook URL when instantiating the template.
